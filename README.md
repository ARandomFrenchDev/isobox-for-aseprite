You can set a custom color for each of the sides, set a highlight and stroke color. You can also choose between two types of the corners: 2px and 3px. You can read more about the differences [here](http://www.gas13.ru/v3/tutorials/isometric_pixelart_tutorial_the_two_types.php).

There are two versions of the script: Regular and Lite. Lite version generates a stroke only boxes, intended for quick prototyping with basic wired box without any colors.
